**---------------PROJECT 1--------------**

**Simple To-Do List Application**

This is a basic command-line To-Do List application written in Python. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, viewing, marking as done, and deleting tasks.

_Features_

Add a new task: Easily add new items to your to-do list.

View all tasks: See a comprehensive list of all your tasks, along with their completion status.

Mark a task as done: Mark tasks as complete once you've finished them. Completed tasks are indicated with a checkmark (checkmark).

Delete a task: Remove tasks from your list that are no longer needed.



**---------------PROJECT 2--------------**

**Simple System Monitor**

This is a basic command-line system monitoring tool written in Python. It provides a quick snapshot of your system's CPU, memory, and disk (C: drive by default) usage at a given moment.

_Features_

CPU Usage: Displays the current CPU utilization percentage.

Memory Usage: Shows the current RAM usage percentage.

Disk Usage: Reports the percentage of used space on a specified disk partition (defaults to C:/ on Windows-like systems).

Timestamped Logs: Each status report is timestamped for easy tracking.


**---------------PROJECT 3--------------**

**Simple Network Monitor**

This is a very basic Python script designed to periodically check the reachability of specified hosts (using ping) and the status of designated TCP ports. It's intended as a straightforward example of network monitoring fundamentals.

_Features_

Host Reachability Check: Uses the system's ping command to determine if a host is online.

TCP Port Status Check: Attempts to connect to specified TCP ports to see if they are open.

Periodic Monitoring: Runs checks at a configurable interval.

Console Output: Prints real-time status updates directly to the terminal.

Simple & Self-Contained: All logic is in a single Python file with hardcoded targets for ease of use.
